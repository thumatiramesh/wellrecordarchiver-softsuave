From the blog: https://www.amplenote.com/blog/2019_examples_amazon_textract_rekognition_microsoft_cognitive_services_google_vision

I believe some of the strongest OCR libraries are:
 - https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/
 - https://aws.amazon.com/textract
 - https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr
 - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-recognizing-text
